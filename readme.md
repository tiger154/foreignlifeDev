## About Sinbie

Sinbie is a web application to help all travelers in any country. 
I got an Idea while I was traveling all around of world, everytime I faced many difficulty for basic stuffs sucs as 
Tranportation, Food, Rent, etc.

I know there are some sites for instance tripadvisor, yalp, etc. But all these type of sites are more friendly with English speakers. 
With my experience as a Korean most of people even don't know that kind of site exist. 
I beilieve there is some problem to give different language speakr proper experience. 

Therefore our first mission is providing localized experience to each language speaker.
And start with Korean user and England user first. 


## Services

So here is first plan to provide services to all users

- Questions
- Community
- Rent
- Study
- Sell & Buy


## Brand story

When I go to other country everytime I felt like a newbie. 
and 'new' in Korean is Sin. so it merged two word (newbie + sin(신))

Also this mered word has other meaning in Korean as 'mystique' which I felt everytime when I land other country :)
